Fractal provides a programmatic API that allows you to {{ link('@custom-commands', 'write custom commands') }}, {{ link('@build-tools', 'tie it into your build tools') }} or help with integrating your component library into your {{ link('@production', 'production site or application') }}.

If you've created a {{ link('@project-settings', 'project settings file') }} for your project then you have already interacted with the Fractal API.
