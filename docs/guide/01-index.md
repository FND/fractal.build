Fractal is a tool to help you **build** and **document** web component libraries and then **integrate** them into your projects.

Component (or pattern) libraries are a way of designing and building websites in a modular fashion, breaking up the UI into small, reusable chunks that can then later be assembled in a variety of ways to build anything from larger components right up to whole pages.

Fractal helps you assemble, preview and document website component libraries, and then integrate them into your web sites, apps and build processes to create joined up, 'living' projects.

Fractal can be run from the command line or integrated into your project via it's API.


## Requirements

Fractal requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v4.0+ to run.

## About this guide
