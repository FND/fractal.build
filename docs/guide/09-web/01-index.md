title: Web UI
---

The Fractal web UI provides a web-based interface to browse your components and their associated files, as well as read project documentation.

The UI itself is generated by _themes_, allowing the interface (and URLs) to be {{ link('@customisation-web', 'completely customised') }}, if required. The {{ link('@default-theme', 'default theme') }} (called 'Mandelbrot') that ships with Fractal also supports a number of customisation options if you don't want to roll your own custom theme from scratch.
