Fractal is installed as a Node module in your project using NPM.

There is also an (optional, but recommended) Command-Line Interface (CLI) helper which can be installed globally on your system, again using NPM.

## Requirements

Fractal requires Node v4.0+ to run.

## Installing Fractal in your project

If you have not already created a folder for your project, do so now and then run `npm init` from within the folder to initialise your project directory.

Once this is done, run:

```
npm install --save @frctl/fractal
```

to install Fractal in your project.
