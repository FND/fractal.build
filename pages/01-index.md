Fractal docs

Fractal is a tool to help you **build**, **document** and **integrate** component libraries into web projects. It's focus is on providing a flexible tool that can be used for both component library development _and_ for helping integrate those components into your site, application or build pipelines.

Fractal can also help you generate 'living' documentation pages for your component library to ensure that your components and documentation never need to go out of sync again.
